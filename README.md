# Face Detector Web App

This repository contains a face detector web application built using Flask, OpenCV, and dlib. The application captures video from your webcam, detects faces, and displays the video feed with detected faces highlighted.

## Project Overview

The Face Detector Web App is designed to showcase real-time face detection capabilities using popular machine learning and computer vision libraries. The application leverages the dlib library's pre-trained shape predictor to identify facial landmarks and OpenCV to process video frames and highlight detected faces.

## Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam feed.
- Highlights detected faces with bounding boxes.
- Utilizes dlib's shape predictor for accurate facial landmark detection.
- Simple web interface built with Flask.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Flask**: Web framework for Python
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision
- **dlib**: Toolkit for machine learning
- **HTML**: Markup language for creating web pages

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.4 installed
- Git installed
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Future Enhancements

- **Hosting:** Explore other free hosting options like AWS Free Tier, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.
- **Enhancements:** Improve the web interface and add more features such as image upload for face detection.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of a face detection web application using Flask, OpenCV, and dlib. The setup process, issues encountered, and their resolutions are documented to assist others in recreating or building upon this application.
